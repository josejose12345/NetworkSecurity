# Network Security scenarios + CCNA
Welcome to my network security projects repository. I am currently working on the CCNA 1 Course: Introduction to Networks. Those labs are found in the `ccna_1` directory. The `personal_projects` directory consists (for the time being) of class scenarios from my cryptography course. Currently there a 2 main personal projects:

 - **Intrusion with Telnet and SSH**: How the cryptography affects the security of these 2 protocols against an external threat. Implemented using physical CISCO switches and routers, and an external PC with Wireshark as the attacker.
 - **Access Control Lists - Defining privacy rules**:  Implementing firewall given privacy rules on CISCO devices.

Feel free to take a look around.
